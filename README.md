# Automatic-plant-watering-system-Arduino
My tropical room plant was dying. I saved it by creating an irrigation system. 
My Arduino script read the Brazilian weather forecast and opened a valve whenever it was raining

What you need to make it yourself:
- nodeMCU esp 8266
- servo
- water valve
- tube
- some kind of water container, I used an old milk bottle

How to build it:
- connect the tube to the container with some hot glue and the water valve, depending on what kind of valve you are using you can use some ty-raps.
- then conect the valve to your servo, make sure it is proparly secured
- connect the servo to your nodeMCU and voila!
